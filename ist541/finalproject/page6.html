			<p>When you run, even if you run alone, you automatically are part of the greater running community. Many apps offer ways to engage with other runners through social media, but one of the most energizing ways to connect is by participating in a running event.</p>
				
			<p>It is common for cities and organizations to host "fun runs" to celebrate holidays or to serve as fund raisers. Typically these events include a 1-mile, 2-mile, or 5k run on a paved urban course.</p> 
				
			<p>If you're looking for a little more adventure, then consider participating in a Brazen Racing event. Brazen Racing hosts trail runs throughout the greater Bay Area, including the north, east, and south bays. Almost all races offer a 5k, 10k, and half-marathon option. Some races include 30k or marathon distances, too. Brazen Racing's philosophy is that &quot;<em>running makes people happy and that the happiness spreads to others,</em>&quot; and the energy cultivated at their lively events reflects this belief.</p>
